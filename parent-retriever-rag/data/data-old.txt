Router, CPE &  Device all mean the same thing."
How does a Device or CPE establish a session with Xmidt? What is the type of that connection? How is authorization done for this session? How is the websocket session kept alive?,"The device establishes the secure websockets or WSS connection to RDK Backend or Xmidt Cloud shortly after the device boots.

During the secure websocket connection is established, the Xmidt Cloud SHALL check the authorization of the device before any user messages are routed to or from the device.

If the Xmidt Cloud is satisfied with the authorization available for the device the Xmidt Cloud SHALL send the message with the status of 200 set.

It SHALL then proceed to route messages to and from the device.
The routing continues until a device is no longer authorized.
If the Xmidt Cloud is not pleased with the certification or authorization provided by the device, it SHALL send the response message with the appropriate status set and MAY disconnect the session.

If a device fails an authorization, the Xmidt Cloud SHALL respond to the device with the authorization response message with the status of 401 set.

At any time, either party may disconnect the session for any reason.

The connection request MAY result in a HTTP redirect to the device, so the device MUST be prepared to support that request.

Once a session is established, websocket ping messages MUST be sent from the device to the Xmidt Cloud periodically. The Xmidt Cloud MUST respond with a websocket pong.

All session initiation originates from the device.

The device SHALL NOT listen for any connection initiated by the Xmidt Cloud."
What is the purpose of the Webhooks stored by Xmidt? Which component in Xmidt ecossytem is responsible for storing these? ,"	
Registered webhooks are the �only stored state�.

What does the 'capabilityCheck' config do in Argus' configuration YAML? Can I control how a request is handled with this config?,"CapabilityCheck provides the details needed for checking an incoming JWT's capabilities.

If the type of check isn't provided, no checking is done.

The type can be ""monitor"" or ""enforce"".

- If ""monitor"" is provided, the capabilities are checked but the request isn't rejected when there isn't a valid capability for the request. Instead, a message is logged.
- When ""enforce"" is provided, a request that doesn't have the needed capability is rejected."
How is 'accessLevel' config different from 'capabilityCheck' config in Argus's configuration file? What is the difference between capabilityCheck and accessLevel in Argus component's configuration?,"accessLevel differs from capabilityCheck:

- capabilityCheck verifies whether a user is allowed to use an API endpoint.
- accessLevel allows more complex access hierarchy.
- accessLevel assigns a number to the user's request which application code can use for security purposes.
- An access level is defined as a non-negative number and the higher the number, the higher the access the request has for the target application."
How is a capability defined in Argus configuration? What guidelines do I need to follow when defining a capability. ,"Capability format:

- The capability is expected to have the format: {prefix}{endpoint}:{method}
- The prefix can be a regular expression.
- If it's empty, no capability check is done.
- The endpoint is a regular expression that should match the endpoint the request was sent to.
- The method is usually the method of the request, such as GET.

What could be a reason if Caduceus is not receving any events? How should I fix this issue?,"If Caduceus is not receving any events, then it means that Talaria has not been configured correctly to talk to Caduceus. 

To fix this, update the Talaria configuration with the right path of Caduceus service."
What are some Xmidt services that support tracing?,"Support for tracing via Opentelemetry can be enabled for the following Xmidt components through their respective configs:

- Tr1d1um
- Scytale
- Argus
- Caduceus
- Talaria
- Petasos
- Themis"
What is the Parodus component in Xmidt? Where is the Parodus component siutated?,Parodus is a websocket client which connects to server in the cloud & delivers messages to and from services running on the gateway device which is the CPE or the Router. Parodus is a platform independent websocket client and nanomsg server that lives on the CPE or the Client Premises Equipment.
Explain the function of Parodus in Xmidt Architecture. Give the answer in 3 or 4 lines and in a paragraph. ,"Parodus is the client device broker. It is tasked with connecting up to the specified fabric.xmidt.example.com URL so that it can be managed as well as provide near real time upstream data. Parodus also has hooks to provide for acquiring JWT credentials to present to Talaria upon connection. After connection, it's role is to maintain connection to the XMiDT cluster at all times as well as shuttle messages between a client and the cluster."
Explain the function of Talaria in Xmidt Architecture. Explain this briefly in just 3 or 4 lines.,"At the other end of the Parodus connections is a collection of Talaria machines. Their job is to keep the connections open to the devices and pass messages to and from the device. A small amount of JWT authorization checking is done in Talaria to ensure the device is allowed, as well as keeping the Consul cluster up to date with it's existence."
Explain the function of Petasos in Xmidt Architecture. What does Petasos do? Explain Petasos' functioning in 3-4 lines.,"Petasos machines are a redirector service based on a consistent hash. The Petasos machines for a data center/region/zone communicate with Consul to determine the number of Talaria machines. Once it knows the count of Talaria instances, it can perform a hash based on the device-id of the incoming device to determine where in the cluster the device should go. An HTTP redirection response is sent to the device which then connects directly to the target Talaria."
Explain the function of Caduceus in Xmidt Architecture. How does Caduceus help in event delivery?,"For outward bound events (flow only one direction), Caduceus provides the needed protection of the XMiDT cluster from the demands of the servers in other services that ultimate wish to consume the events. Delivery is attempted for all events & Caduceus handles both slowly consuming clients as well as scaling to very large clients."
Explain the function of Scytale in Xmidt Architecture. How does Scytale function in a cloud environment that is spread across multiple AZs or Availability Zones?,"The XMiDT API is served by Scytale. The basic job of this machine is to authenticate the cloud caller, accept the request and fan out the request to all possible Talaria machines that are targeted by the request. If an XMiDT cluster is deployed in 3 separate data centers or availability zones for high availability, Scytale will be configured (either directly or through Consul) to forward a request to a particular device to the 3 possible Talaria machines where the device could reside."
What is WebPA with respect to Xmidt or RDK? What is the significance of WebPA in the Xmidt or RDK Ecosystem?,WebPA is the communication channel from Cloud to RDK based home gateway devices. It helps to manage devices from Cloud. WEBPA protocol provides functionality of read/write access to device management parameters in an efficient manner as compared to TR-69 or SNMP.
Explain WebPA as briefly as possible.,"WebPA is a ""Protocol Agent"" that facilitates remote management of gateway devices."
Why does XMiDT need WRP? ,"The XMiDT service is designed to be able to travel across different connection types (HTTP, Websocket, Nanomsg, etc) and subsequently needs a mechanism to collect all the details needed to deliver, process and respond to a request."
What happens when Parodus boots up on a Router?,"Parodus first uses CM MAC to identify the device, then connects to the fabric URL, and finally redirects to a Talaria server."
Does Parodus maintain a persistent connection to Xmidt or RDK Backend? Does it also have a reconnection logic?,"Yes, Parodus utilizes a persistent WebSocket (WSS) connection to ensure reliable communication with Xmidt Cloud. This WSS connection allows for real-time data exchange. If the connection is lost for any reason, Parodus automatically attempts to re-establish it."
What is Libparodus used for?,WebPA client (parodus2ccsp) and other micro-services use Libparodus to communicate with the Parodus client.
What role does Nanomsg play?,It's an open-source library for internal socket abstraction between Parodus and other components.
How does Parodus handle data flow?,It sends downstream cloud requests to the device's corresponding service and sends upstream events to the cloud.
What is the primary function of Parodus as an Xmidt client?,"It provides communication between clients and the server, acting as a client device broker/coordinator."
Are there different Parodus client types available in the Xmidt ecosystem?,"Yes, Parodus offers two client types to cater to different needs: 
- Send & Receive Clients: These clients have full functionality, allowing them to both send requests to Xmidt Cloud and receive data from the cloud. 
- Receive Only Clients: These clients can only receive data (upstream events) from Xmidt Cloud, but cannot send requests themselves."
How Parodus does communicate with other clients on the same router or device?,"
- Nanomsg is used to communicate with Parodus on The device.
- Nanomsg acts like internal bus.
- Client Server model is used where Parodus is server.
- This replaces The previously defined RPC mechanisms.
- Message queues are implemented for both incoming WRP messages and outgoing WRP messages from nanomsg.
-  This is same as nopoll incoming and outgoing queue architecture"
Briefly explain what Petasos is. Try it in as short as possible.,HTTP redirector component of the Xmidt Cloud
What's Petasos' primary function? How is a router or device's MAC Address important to Petasos?,"Petasos acts as an HTTP redirector, playing a crucial role in directing incoming requests to the appropriate Talaria node within the Xmidt Cloud infrastructure. It achieves this by leveraging a consistent hashing function based on the device's unique MAC address."
What hashing mechanism does Petasos use? Are there any benefits of using a consistent-hashing function?,"Petasos employs a consistent hashing function to distribute device connections across Talaria machines. This hashing function ensures that devices with similar IDs are likely to be directed to the same Talaria node, promoting load balancing and efficient management."
How does Petasos protect Talaria during mass reboots? What is the role of Petasos in the scenario when a large number of routers reboot?,"During scenarios like mass reboots where a large number of devices attempt to connect simultaneously, Petasos plays a vital role in managing the load on Talaria machines. By calculating the target Talaria for each device based on its ID, Petasos distributes the incoming connection requests across different Talaria nodes. This helps prevent overloading any single Talaria machine and ensures smoother handling of mass reboots."
How does Petasos determine the number of Talaria machines? How is Petasos made aware of the number of Talaria instances available for it?,"Petasos relies on Consul, a service registry tool, to discover the available Talaria machines within a specific domain (data center/region/zone). By communicating with Consul, Petasos obtains an up-to-date count of active Talaria machines, enabling it to make informed decisions about redirecting device connections."
What information does Petasos use to determine the target Talaria? What pieces of information are required to determine the correct destination Talaria?,"Petasos utilizes two key pieces of information to identify the appropriate Talaria for an incoming device connection:
- Device ID: The device's unique MAC address serves as the primary factor. Petasos applies a consistent hashing function to this ID, resulting in a specific Talaria node responsible for handling that particular device.
� Service Discovery Configuration: In conjunction with the device ID, Petasos also considers service discovery information to ensure the redirection aligns with the overall service configuration within Xmidt Cloud."
Does Petasos offer configuration options for Talaria coordination? What confuguration options exist for managing Talaria coordination?,"Yes, Petasos provides flexibility in managing Talaria coordination through two configuration options: 
- Dynamic coordination via Consul (consul option): This approach leverages Consul's service registry to dynamically discover and adapt to changes in the number of available Talaria machines. 
- Static configuration with a predefined Talaria list (fixed option): Here, an administrator can define a static list of Talaria nodes that Petasos will use for redirection. This option might be suitable for scenarios with a fixed Talaria deployment."
How does Petasos handle URI paths in requests? Does it fo any validation of the URI path for the requests it receives?,"Petasos primarily focuses on directing the device or service towards the correct Talaria node. When a request arrives, Petasos takes the entire request, including any URI paths (e.g., /api/v2/device, /api/v2/device/send), and redirects it to the target Talaria. Petasos itself doesn't perform any parsing or validation of the URI path; it simply forwards the complete request for the Talaria to handle."
What HTTP header is required by Petasos for request completion? What is the significance of the X-Webpa-Device-Name Header in requests received by petasos?,"To successfully process a request and perform redirection, Petasos mandates the inclusion of the ""X-Webpa-Device-Name"" header in the request. This header likely plays a role in identifying the specific device or service making the request and ensures proper handling within Petasos."
How does the Petasos or Xmidt Device API handle HTTP redirections?,"The Xmidt Device API leverages HTTP redirection mechanisms for specific situations. When interacting with the Xmidt Device API, clients should be prepared to encounter and follow HTTP redirections. These redirections are not indicative of errors but rather a normal part of the communication flow within Xmidt Cloud."
What is the maximum redirection limit for clients in Petasos config?,"To prevent infinite loops or unintended consequences, there's a limit on the number of HTTP redirections that clients can follow. The Xmidt Device API enforces a maximum redirection limit of 5. If a client encounters more than 5 redirections for a single request, it might indicate an issue with the configuration or service discovery mechanism."
What is the redirect API used by Petasos? Mention its http type as well.,"Petasos has only one main API, that it uses to redirect incoming requests to the right Talaria. It is of http type POST and is /api/v2/device/send"
What different Xmidt components talk to Petasos within the Xmidt or RDK Ecosystem?,"Petasos only receives requests from either Talaria or Scytale. The two types of requests are:
- from a device looking to connect to talaria, and 
- from scytale looking to forward a request to a device."
What is the health API in Petasos?,The GET /health API is to fetch the current health status of Petasos component.
What is the metrics API in Petasos?,The GET /metrics API is to fetch the current metrics being published by Petasos component.
What are some important metrics published by Petasos? What metrics may Prometheus scrape when it discovers the metric endpoint for Petasos?,"Petasos publishes some important metrics around connections, requests & service discovery that describe the state of the microservice at that point. These are:

To fix this:
Change Talaria and Petasos Configuration to be consistent with http or https."
What are the different APIs available within Scytale?,"Scytale has 2 main APIs or endpoints that are exposed:

1. GET  /api/v3/device/{deviceID}/stat : Get Device Statistics
2. POST /api/v3 /device : Send WRP message to Device"
What does the /device/{deviceID}/stat API do in Scytale? What error may I face when executing this API.,"The /api/v3/device/{deviceID}/stat API belongs to Scytale, and is of http type GET. It is used to return the the statistics of the connected device, including information such as uptime and bytes sent. This information is retrieved from the Talaria that the device is connected to. If the Device is not connected then 404 is returned. Note that the deviceID should be like  mac:112233445566"
What does the /device API do in Scytale? Is it used to communicate with a router device?,"The /api/v3/device API belongs to Scytale, and is of http type POST. It is used to send Send Web routing protocol (WRP) message to Device or Router. Accepts a WRP message encoded in a valid WRP representation
(generally msgpack or json). Scytale then forwards the request to the correct Talaria. If the Device is not connected then 404 is returned."
What is the health API in Scytale?,The GET /health API is to fetch the current health status of Scytale component.

"
What does a 404 response in Scytale's API indicate? How may one be it comes up? able to fix the 404 response when,"404 is a pretty common error scenarios, which indicates that the device is not connected to the cluster. This may be happening because Parodus (ie the component in CPE connecting to Talaria) has an incorrrect URL. To fix this, one must validate that Parodus holds the correct URL at its end. "
What's Talaria's primary function? Explain the purpose of Talaria when talking about Xmod,"Talaria is a critical service of the Xmidt ecosystem that enables communication between Xmidt Cloud clients (devices/routers/CPEs) and the backend itself. It manages millions of device connections, forwards device events, and sends/receives requests from devices."
How does Talaria communicate with devices? What is the benefits of webhooks for Talaria. ,"Talaria utilizes secure WebSocket connections to communicate with devices. WebSockets provide a persistent, bi-directional communication channel, ideal for real-time data exchange. Additionally, Talaria leverages WRP messages, a data format specifically designed for efficient communication within Xmidt Cloud."
What is the role of Talaria service?,Talaria service ensure continuous connections with devices and facilitate message exchange between routers and the cloud.
Can Talaria generate events?,"Yes, Talaria can not only forward device-generated events but also originate its own events. These events might be triggered by internal Talaria actions or specific conditions within the system. Regardless of the source, Talaria sends these events to Caduceus, the event delivery service within Xmidt Cloud, for further processing and distribution to interested consumers."
How does Talaria handle device authorization? Can Talaria also reject requests?,"Talaria acts as a gatekeeper for device access to Xmidt Cloud services. It performs JWT (JSON Web Token) authorization using tokens issued by Themis, a security component within Xmidt Cloud. This authorization check ensures that a device is authorized to send data (GET/SET requests) before Talaria processes its requests. If the JWT check fails, Talaria rejects the request."
How is a device session established with Xmidt Cloud or RDK Backend?,"Shortly after booting up, a device takes the initiative to establish a secure WebSocket connection with Talaria (Xmidt Cloud). During this connection handshake, Talaria performs critical steps: 
1. Authorization Check: Talaria validates the device's authorization using the JWT token included in the connection request. If the authorization check fails, the connection attempt is rejected. 
2. Message Routing: Upon successful authorization, Talaria establishes a bi-directional communication channel with the device. Now, Talaria can route messages between the device and Xmidt Cloud services."
What happens if a device fails authorization with Talaria?,"If a device's JWT authorization check fails during the session establishment process, Talaria responds with a specific message indicating a 401 (Unauthorized) status. This response might be accompanied by a session disconnection, preventing unauthorized devices from accessing Xmidt Cloud services."
How does the authorization model work for device sessions with Talaria?,"Authorization with Talaria primarily occurs during the initial session setup and periodically afterward. This approach avoids excessive credential validation for each request/event, improving scalability for large device deployments."
Out of Talaria and the Router who  initiates the session connection?,The device always initiates the WebSocket connection to establish a session with Xmidt Cloud (Talaria).
What is the role of ping/pong messages for Talaria in a session?,"Once a session is established, devices must periodically send ping messages to Talaria, which responds with pong messages.  These ping messages act as a heartbeat mechanism. This mechanism verifies the aliveness of both parties in the connection."
What are the Talaria API endpoints for device interaction?,"Talaria offers three primary API endpoints for interacting with connected devices: 
1. Device Statistics: /device/{deviceID}/stat : Function: Provides statistics about a specific device identified by its ID. 
2. Get Devices:  /devices : Function: Retrieves a list of all connected devices. (Not to be used in production environment due to potential scalability issues)
3. Send WRP to Device: /device/send : Function: Allows sending WRP messages directly to a specific device."
Why shouldn't Routers or Xmidt Cloud clients directly query Talaria?,"CPES or Routers or Xmidt Cloud clients should avoid directly querying Talaria for device information or sending messages. Instead, they are encouraged to route requests through WebPA (Tr1d1um), the official Xmidt Cloud API, which provides a more controlled and secure communication channel."
How can Talaria control connected routers or devices?,"Talaria offers a built-in control server exposing functionalities for managing connected devices. This control server allows for: 
1.  /device/gate : To Gate devices. Controls whether specific devices can connect to this particular Talaria instance, essentially allowing or denying device connections. 
2.  /device/drain : To drain devices.  Removes connected devices from the Talaria instance, effectively disconnecting them."
What role does JWT play in device interaction with Talaria? At what point is WJWA,"Talaria utilizes JWT (JSON Web Token) for basic device authentication and to prevent potential spoofing attempts. Here's a breakdown: 
* JWT Claims: JWT claims are used to compare specific device attributes like MAC address, serial number, and transaction UUID with corresponding headers included in the connection request. 

* Optional JWT Usage: While JWT is not mandatory, it can be used to verify the legitimacy of a device by comparing claim data with header attributes. The primary purpose is to prevent devices from impersonating others. 

* Validation Scope: Talaria validates JWT tokens during the initial WebSocket connection establishment, not for every single request sent through the connection. Once the connection is established, Talaria relies on internal mechanisms to manage and filter traffic."
How does JWT prevent spoofing?,"Even though JWTs are not encrypted, they are cryptographically signed. This signature verification helps prevent a malicious actor from impersonating another device. A bad actor could potentially exploit a compromised JWT, but only to impersonate that specific device, not any other device in the system."
What role does JWT play in device interaction with Talaria?,"Talaria utilizes JWT (JSON Web Token) for basic device authentication and to prevent potential spoofing attempts. Here's a breakdown:

- Validation Scope: Talaria validates JWT tokens during the initial WebSocket connection establishment, but not every single request sent through the connection. Once the connection is established, Talaria relies on internal mechanisms to manage and filter traffic."
What is the message validation approach in Talaria?,"Talaria employs selective message validation. It focuses on validating the WebSocket connection itself during establishment, where JWT verification might occur. Once the connection is established, Talaria relies on its internal mechanisms to manage and potentially filter traffic flowing through that connection. This approach aims to balance security with scalability considerations."
What is the message validation approach in Talaria?,"Xmidt Cloud operates under the assumption of trust for internal services. Once a message reaches Talaria, any component receiving the message upstream is expected to implicitly trust the sender. An alternative approach involving cryptographically signed messages for validation by upstream consumers is mentioned but considered less scalable for the vast number of messages within Xmidt Cloud."
"What information does the ""Convey Token"" contain in Talaria?","The ""Convey Token"" includes metadata associated with the device. This metadata is likely passed by Parodus as HTTP headers within the connection request."
"How does Talaria handle the ""Convey Token""?","Talaria extracts the metadata from the ""Convey Token"" and constructs a ""Convey Object."" This object is then added to device options for further processing within Talaria."
"How is the ""Convey Token"" transmitted?","The ""Convey Token"" is provided by Parodus in two ways: 
1. HTTP Header: Parodus includes it as a request attribute named ""X-Webpa-Convey"" within the connection request. 
2. Logs: The ""Convey Token"" is also persisted in logs maintained by Petasos Server, Talaria events, and Talaria server logs (at ""info"" level)."
"If CPE ws connection is closed by any reason  and at the same time 
we had received a request to apply some configurations on the CPE 
what will be happening in this case?","CPE has a  logic to connect to talaria which is in infinite loop unless it is connected.

During any request to apply some configuration to CPE while it is retrying connection:
1. if CPE is not connected  then 404 will be returned to user.
2. There is no need to Queue the data and apply it later when the CPE is online again, since Tr1d1um has a retry mechanism "
What APIs are exposed by Talaria to gate or limit devices to Xmidt?,"Talaria can be set to disallow incoming websocket connections. When the gate is closed, all incoming websocket connection requests are rejected with a 503 status.

Talaria always starts with the gate open, allowing new websocket connections. Already connected websockets are not affected by closing the gate.

The RESTful endpoint that controls this is /api/v2/device/gate.

The following APIs or endpoints are exposed by Talaria to gate incoming connections:

1. /device/gate : used to open or close a gate. Can be of http type PUT, POST or PATCH. If the gate is open then only it will be accepting the WS connections else it will be returning 503 status.
2. /device/gate?open=<boolean> : used to fetch current status of gate, whether its open or closed. Can be of http type GET. Any attempt to open the gate when it is already open or close it when it is already closed results in a 200 status. If this endpoint did change the status of the gate, a 201 status is returned.
"
What are the different APIs are exposed by Talaria to drain router connections?,"Talaria supports the draining of websocket connections. Essentially, this means shedding load in a controlled fashion.

Websocket connections can be drained at a given rate, e.g. 100 connections/minute, or can be drained as fast as possible.
Only 1 drain job is permitted to be running at any time. Attempts to start a drain when one is already active results in an error.

We need to close the device gate so that it will no accept the new connections request and we can drain the connections as per our need.
The RESTful endpoint that controls the connection drain is /api/v2/device/drain.


The following APIs or endpoints are exposed by Talaria to drain connections:

1. /device/drain : when used with http type GET, then this will return the current status of the drain job whether the job is active and previous drain job status
2. /device/drain : when used with http type PUT, POST, or PATCH, then this will register a job at the server with the given inputs, and then attempts to start a drain job. If no parameters are supplied, all devices are drained as fast as possible.
3. /device/drain : when used with http type DELETE, then this will halt or cancel the running drain job. "
"What parameters may be supplied to a PUT, POST, or PATCH call to the /device/drain endpoint so as to customize the drain behaviour?","Several parameters may be supplied to customize the drain behavior of a Talaria node or service. 
1. count: indicates the maximum number of websocket connections to close.
2. percent: indicates the percentage of connections to close. has a higher priority than count when specified together.
3. rate: indicates the number of connections per unit time (tick) to close. If this value is not supplied, connections are closed as fast as possible.
4. tick: indicates the unit of time for rate. If rate is supplied and tick is not supplied, a tick of 1s is used. If rate is not supplied and tick is supplied, tick is ignored. When Tick is provided with Rate then it will drop the no of connections per Tick time. When Nothing is provided it will be dropping the WS connections as fast as possible"
What are Talaria's API endpoints for interacting with devices?,"Talaria offers three API endpoints for interacting with routers or devices. Below 3 APIs need a JWT token for authentication, else 403 is returned.

1. /device/{deviceID}/stat - Returns the statistics of the connected device, including information such as uptime and bytes sent. It is of http type GET. This request does not communicate with the device, instead the request returns stored statistics that are stored ""in-memory"" of the talaria instance.
2. /devices - Used to return a list of all the actively connected devices and their statistics, just like the stat command. Is of http type GET. This API is not recommended for use in production as it is an expensive call.
3. /device/send - Http type is POST. API is used to Send WRP messages to a specific device. Talaria will accept a WRP message encoded in a valid WRP representation - generally msgpack or json. If the message is json encoded, talaria will encode the payload as msgpack. If the device returns a message, it will be encoded as the HTTP accept header."
What is the health API in Talaria?,The GET /health API is to fetch the current health status of Talaria component.
What is the metrics API in Talaria?,The GET /metrics API is to fetch the current metrics being published by Talaria component.

"
Is there any PII or Personally Identificable Information available inside Talaria Logs?,"Yes, we have confidential user information being printed in Talaria Logs when DEBUG log-level I used. Information like deviceId which is the user's routers's mac address is PII and should be handled carefully."
What are some important metrics published by Talaria for scraping by Observability tools?,"Observability tools like Prometheus are responsible for scraping metrics exposed by microservices in the backend ecosystem, storing them in a TSDB (time series data base) for querying, reporting and alerting. Talaria's code is configured as such to expose information related to its connections, hashes, requests, and service discovery. Following are the metrics exposed by Talaria on port 6204:

41. auth_validation: Counter of Auth validation success/failed."
How does rehashing work in case of Talaria?,"Talaria supports rehashing via service discovery, which can be done either by Consul or Zookeeper. In case of Consul, when a new Talaria instance is added, rehashing takes place. The flow is:

1. On startup, every talaria will self-register itself and consul.
2. Once talaria is successfully registered in consul we will be getting an event in the talaria.
3. Based on that event internal consistent hash table will be updated in talaria
4. Few CPE WS connections will be dropped which should not be on this talaria instance.
5. Again CPE will try to get talaria information from petasos
6. Petasos will be sharing new talaria information with the CPE
7. CPE will be connecting to the new talaria instance now."
Which file in Talaria's code is responsible for handling the rehashing?,"The rehasher.go file in Talaria's opensource code is responsible for managing the rehashing logic. It is situated in the webpa-common repository. The code is written in Golang, and is available on Github. The URL to the specific file is: https://github.com/xmidt-org/webpa-common/blob/main/device/rehasher/rehasher.go"
Is it possible to simulate a device to test connection behaviour with RDK or Xmidt backend?,"Yes, one can either use the RDK-B Simulator or a Kratos client to simulate or mock a device that would connect to RDK Backend or the Xmidt cluster. The core part of the device simulator that connects to Talaria is Parodus. 

The difference between Kratos and RDK-Simulator is that kratos can mock Parodus (Xmdit Agent on the CPE), whereas RDKB Device Simulator mocks an entire RDK-B device."
What is Kratos with respect to RDK and Xmidt ecosystem?,"Kratos is a websocket wrapper that provides a simple API for making new connections, sending messages on that connection, and providing a way to handle received messages. It's codebase is opensource and available on Github at https://github.com/xmidt-org/kratos"
What may be happening when Talaria is not showing up in Consul?,"Talaria is responsible for registering itself with Consul at startup. To check if a talaria instance is successfully registered with Consul for service-discovery, one can run this command on a Consul node to test if Talaria is registered or not:
consul catalog services

If Talaria does not show up in the list, then validate Consul's client block in Talaria's config, with correct TLS and address. "
What may be happening when Caduceus is not receving any events from Talaria?,"If it has been detected that Caduceus is not receiving events, then one must update the Talaria's config yaml with the correct information of caduceu's FQDN, port and its /api/v3/notify endpoint. "
Is there any PII or Personally Identificable Information Available in Themis' Logs?,There is no PII (personally identifiable information) printed in Themis' logs. However do not that using DEBUG log-level in Prod is not recommended.
What are some configs or configurations that I can tweak for Themis? I would like to customize the behaviour of how tokens generated by Themis are treated.,"Themis allows configuring certaing values that influence how it generates and treats tokens. These values are available in Themis' opensource code in Github on https://github.com/xmidt-org/themis/blob/main/themis.yaml. Some of these config values are:

1. token.alg: Alg is the required JWT signing algorithm to use (Default Value: RS256)
2. token.nonce: Nonce indicates whether a nonce (jti) should be applied to each token emitted by this factory. (Default Value: FALSE)
3. token.duration: Duration specifies how long the token should be valid for. An exp claim is set using this duration from the current time if this field is positive. (Default Value: NONE)
4. token.notBeforeDelta: NotBeforeDelta is a golang duration that determines the nbf field. This field is parsed and added to the current time at the moment a token is issued. The result is set as an nbf claim. Note that the duration may be zero or negative. (Default Value: NONE)
5. token.claims: Claims is an optional map of claims to add to every token emitted by this factory. Any claims here can be overridden by claims within a token Request. (Default Value: NONE)
6. token.metadata: Metadata describes non-claim data, which can be statically configured or supplied via a request. Will be useful while sending the request to remote server. (Default Value: NONE)
7. token.remote.method: Method is the HTTP method used to invoke the URL (Default Value: POST)
8. token.remote.url: URL is the remote endpoint that is expected to receive Request.Metadata and return a JSON document which is merged into the token claims (Default Value: NONE)
9. token.key.kid: Kid is the key id to use initially. If unset, the name of the key is used. Note that the kid can change is the key is rotated or updated during application execution. (Default Value: NONE)
10. token.key.type: Type indicates the type of key. This field dictates both how the key File is read or how the key is generated. (Default Value: RSA)
11. token.key.bits: Bits indicates the bit size for a generated key (Default Value: NONE)
12. token.key.file: File is the system path to a file where the key is stored. If set, this file must exist and contain either a secret or a PEM-encoded key pair. If this field is not set, a key is generated. (Default Value: NONE)"
What is WebPA within the Xmidt ecosystem? What other name is WebPA also known as?,WebPA is a software component within Xmidt that facilitates communication with devices adhering to the TR-181 data model. It is also referred to as Tr1d1um.
What functionalities does the WebPA server or Tr1d1um offer?,"Tr1d1um offers functionalities like:

- RESTful API: Exposes a RESTful API for interacting with devices using HTTP requests.
- TR-181 Translation: Translates between the WebPA API and the TR-181 data model, enabling communication with TR-181 devices. 
- Device Configuration Management: Allows managing device configurations through GET/SET operations on TR-181 parameters. 
- Event Subscriptions: Provides mechanisms for subscribing to receive notifications about device events."
What's the historical context behind WebPA?,"WebPA was initially designed as a combined service encompassing both core Xmidt routing and TR-181 translation functionalities. However, after large-scale deployments, a decision was made by Comcast to separate these functionalities. The core routing aspects remained within the Xmidt project, while the translation layer evolved into the independent WebPA (Tr1d1um) microservice."
How can Tr1d1um be used for device system configuration?,"Tr1d1um or WebPA empowers Xmidt Cloud to manage device configurations remotely. It allows: 
* Reading Configuration: Retrieving current device configuration settings based on TR-181 parameters. 
* Updating Configuration: Sending commands to devices to modify their configurations according to the TR-181 standard."
How does Tr1d1um collect device information?,"WebPA or Tr1d1um facilitates the collection of ad-hoc device information from connected devices. Devices actively push data like firmware version, XPC configuration details, model, serial number, and boot time to the server. This information is then stored in server statistics and logs for analysis."
What's the purpose of collecting device information by Tr1d1um?,"WebPA-enabled device information collection serves several purposes: 
* Real-time Data Gathering: Provides near real-time access to device data for analytical purposes. 
* Service Level Assurance: Helps ensure that Xmidt Cloud services are meeting performance expectations. 
* Customer Experience Optimization: Contributes to improving the overall customer experience by identifying potential issues and areas for improvement."
How does WebPA interact with TR-181 devices for configuration?,"Tr1d1um or WebPA acts as an intermediary between Xmidt Cloud services and TR-181 devices when managing configurations. It translates between the WebPA API used by Xmidt Cloud and the TR-181 data model understood by the devices. This translation enables Xmidt Cloud to send configuration commands (SET) or retrieve current settings (GET) using the WebPA API, which WebPA then translates into TR-181 commands for the devices to understand."
How can a device be identified in WebPA?,"Tr1d1um supports various formats for device identification using the X-WebPA-Device-Name header. Here are the accepted formats: 
- uuid: {uuid}/{service}/{ignored} 
- dns: {hostname}/{service}/{ignored} 
- mac: {mac address}/{service}/{ignored} 
- serial: {serial number}/{service}/{ignored}"
What's important about device identification formats in Tr1d1um?,"The format chosen for device identification impacts routing. Formats relying on MAC address or serial number (mac:{mac address} or serial:{serial number}) require the device name to be pre-registered. Without pre-registration, routing to the device fails."
What information does the WebPA server extract from the device name?,"WebPA primarily focuses on using the device name for routing purposes. Additional details extracted might depend on the specific format used (e.g., serial number from serial:{serial number})."
How are device name and group membership conveyed within Tr1d1um? What http headers are needed for secure websocket content usage?,"During Secure WebSocket (WSS) connection establishment, HTTP headers are used to share device information: 
* X-WebPA-Device-Name (Required): This header specifies the device name, ideally in the format serial-{serial number}. 
* X-WebPA-Group-Membership (Optional): This optional header contains a comma-separated list of groups the device belongs to."
What is Tr1d1um's role in device communication? What different APIs help enabling these functionalities.,"Tr1d1um (WebPA) acts as a bridge for communication with TR-181 compliant devices. It facilitates functionalities like: 
- /stat : Device Statistics Retrieval: Allows fetching statistics (e.g., uptime) for connected devices using the /stat endpoint. 
- /config : Device Configuration Management: Enables CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on device configurations through the /config endpoints. Tr1d1um validates incoming requests, prepares WRP messages, and interacts with the Xmidt Cloud API for configuration management.
- /hook(s) : Event Subscription: Provides mechanisms for registering event listeners using /hooks endpoints to receive notifications about published Xmidt Cloud events."
How does Tr1d1um handle CRUD operations for device configuration?,"When a configuration request arrives, Tr1d1um performs the following actions: 
1. Validation: Tr1d1um validates the incoming request to ensure its validity. 
2. WRP Message Construction: Tr1d1um encapsulates the validated request data into a SimpleRequestResponse WRP message, a specific message format used within Xmidt Cloud. 
3. Message Encoding: Tr1d1um encodes the constructed WRP message using msgpack, a compact data serialization format, before sending it to the Xmidt Cloud API."
How does Tr1d1um or WebPA authenticate back-end integrations?,"WebPA utilizes OAuth 2.0 ""Client Credential Flow"" for back-end integration authentication. Here's a breakdown: 

- Token Request: RDK Back-End requests an access token using its OAuth 2.0 credentials. 
- Token Type: The access token uses the ""bearer"" type. 
- Token Format: The access token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed with the SHA256 algorithm. 
- JWT Claims: The JWT contains standard claims like audience (aud), expiration time (exp), and a unique JWT identifier (jti). 
- Token Expiration: Access tokens expire after 24 hours (86400 seconds). 
- Transport Security: Communication should leverage Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 with mutual TLS for added security."
What is WRP and what does it do?,WRP (Web Routing Protocol) acts as a core message envelope within Xmidt. It provides a standardized format for messages exchanged between devices and various Xmidt services. WRP facilitates routing messages efficiently across the Xmidt cloud infrastructure.
Why is WRP important for Xmidt?,"Xmidt interacts with a vast number of devices using diverse communication protocols (WebSocket, HTTP, etc.). WRP offers a unified message structure that transcends these protocols, enabling seamless communication and message processing within Xmidt, regardless of the underlying transport mechanism."
How does message encoding work in WRP?,"WRP messages are always encoded using MsgPack for efficient data transmission. This happens regardless of the format (MsgPack, JSON, or HTTP headers) used by the initial API call. Internally, Xmidt services like Skytale convert incoming requests into MsgPack before sending them further."
Are there performance implications with WRP message encoding?,"Yes, converting messages to MsgPack can introduce some overhead. If performance optimization is critical, directly emitting WRP messages in MsgPack format (like Tr1d1um does) can avoid the conversion step and potentially improve performance."
What's the OSI layer stack for WRP communication?,"WRP resides at a higher level within the communication stack. Here's a breakdown (bottom to top): 
- Physical Layer 
- IP Layer 
- TCP Layer 
- TLS/SSL Layer 
- HTTP/WebSocket Layer (depending on the protocol) 
- WRP Layer 
- Application Layer (Xmidt services)"
What are Tr1d1um's API endpoints for fetching device statistics?,Tr1d1um exposes the /stat endpoint or API to fetch the statistics (i.e. uptime) for a given router connected to the Xmidt. This endpoint is a simple shadow of its counterpart on the Xmidt Cloud API (Scytale). Tr1d1um simply passes through the incoming request to XMiDT as it comes and returns whatever response XMiDT provided.
What are Tr1d1um's API endpoints for performing CRUD operations?,"Tr1d1um exposes the /config endpoint or API to set/get multiple values, or to replace or delete entries from the table. The same API has different usage and behaviours when different http types are used:

1. /config         // CRUD operations
1.1.    GET     /device/{device_id}/config          // Get multiple parameter values or attributes
1.2.    PATCH   /device/{device_id}/config          // Set multiple parameter values or attributes
1.3.    POST    /device/{device_id}/config/{table}  // Add entry to table

Tell me everything about Prometheus with respect to Observability,"here's a breakdown of Prometheus in the context of Observability:

Understanding Observability through Prometheus

What is Observability?
Observability is the practice of understanding a system's internal state by analyzing the data it produces. This helps assess an application's health and pinpoint issues quickly. It forms the foundation for ensuring that your systems meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs).

The Three Pillars of Observability:
Observability relies on three pillars: Metrics, Logs, and Traces.

Metrics: Numerical measurements that represent a system's health at a particular point in time. These are collected and stored over time, forming time series data.
Logs: Records of events that occur within a system, providing context about what's happening.
Traces: Detailed records of the path taken by a single request as it travels through a system, providing insights into how the system functions.
Prometheus and Metrics:
Prometheus is an open-source system focused on collecting and analyzing metrics. It excels at:

Multi-dimensional Data Model: Stores metrics along with timestamps and key-value pairs (labels) for detailed analysis.
PromQL: A powerful query language for filtering and analyzing time series data based on labels.
Efficient Storage: Leverages a time series database optimized for efficient metric storage and retrieval.
Alerting: Defines rules to trigger alerts based on specific metric conditions.
Visualization: While not its core function, Prometheus integrates with tools like Grafana for creating informative dashboards.
Why is Prometheus Valuable for Observability?

Simplicity: Easy to set up and use, with a focus on collecting metrics through a pull model (Prometheus pulls data from targets).
Flexibility: PromQL allows for intricate analysis of metrics.
Scalability: Can handle large deployments with proper configuration.
Open Source: Freely available and backed by a strong community.
Prometheus in Action

Imagine a web application experiencing slowdowns. Metrics collected by Prometheus might reveal a spike in request processing time. By analyzing these metrics and potentially correlating them with logs (not directly supported by Prometheus), you can pinpoint the root cause, such as a sudden surge in traffic or a database query inefficiency."

How do Prometheus metrics work?,"Prometheus metrics are the foundation for collecting and analyzing data about how a system behaves over time. Here's a breakdown of how they work:

The Prometheus Cycle:

Exposure:  Applications or systems being monitored need to expose their metrics. This is typically done through:

Client Libraries: Libraries provided by Prometheus for various programming languages allow applications to directly publish metrics to Prometheus.
Exporters: Standalone programs can be deployed to scrape data from systems that don't natively expose metrics and translate it into a Prometheus-compatible format.
Scraping:  Prometheus periodically scrapes metrics from the configured targets (applications or exporters) using HTTP requests.

Storage and Processing:  Scraped metrics are stored locally in Prometheus's time series database.  Prometheus can also perform computations on the data, generating new metrics based on existing ones.

Alerting:  Prometheus allows you to define alerting rules based on metric values. If a rule's condition is met (e.g., CPU usage exceeds a threshold), Prometheus triggers alerts and sends notifications.

Querying and Visualization:  Prometheus provides a powerful query language called PromQL for filtering and analyzing time series data based on metric names and labels.  Tools like Grafana can then be used to visualize the queried data in dashboards for easier comprehension.

Benefits of Prometheus Metrics:

Standardized Approach: Prometheus offers a uniform way to collect and analyze metrics from various sources, simplifying monitoring setups.
Flexibility: PromQL enables intricate analysis of metrics based on labels and time ranges.
Scalability: Prometheus can handle large deployments with proper configuration for scraping and storage.
Open Source: Being open source makes it freely available and fosters a strong community for support and development."
What is Consul? And how does it help service discovery?,"Consul is a service networking solution developed by HashiCorp. It acts as a central control plane that automates various tasks related to service discovery, service mesh, traffic management, and even automated network updates. Here's a breakdown of how Consul helps with service discovery:

Understanding Service Discovery:

In modern architectures with microservices, applications are built as a collection of small, independent services. These services communicate with each other to fulfill user requests. Service discovery becomes crucial in this context, as it allows services to dynamically find and connect to other services they need to interact with.

Consul as the Registry:

Consul acts as a distributed service registry. Here's what that means:

Service Registration: Services running on different machines or containers can register themselves with Consul. This registration process involves providing information like the service name, IP address, port number, and health checks.
Dynamic Service Catalog: Consul maintains a constantly updated catalog of all registered services. This catalog acts as a single source of truth for service locations and health.
Service Discovery for Clients: Applications or services that need to interact with other services can query Consul's service catalog to discover the location (IP address and port) of the desired service. Consul provides various mechanisms for service discovery, including DNS and an HTTP API.
Benefits of Consul for Service Discovery:

Dynamic and Scalable: Consul can handle a large number of services and automatically updates the service catalog as services register, deregister, or change their state.
Resilience: Consul is designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant. Even if some Consul nodes fail, the service discovery process continues to function.
Security: Consul offers features for securing service-to-service communication and access control to the service catalog.
Simplified Development: By centralizing service discovery, Consul reduces the complexity of developing microservices that need to find and interact with each other.
Consul in Action:

Imagine a microservice architecture where a frontend service needs to communicate with a backend service. Here's how Consul helps:

The backend service registers itself with Consul, providing its details like name, IP, and port.
The frontend service queries Consul's service catalog to discover the location of the backend service.
Consul provides the backend service's IP and port, allowing the frontend service to establish communication and make requests.

By leveraging Consul for service discovery and its broader service networking features, you can build more resilient, scalable, and manageable microservice architectures."
Tell me about Caduceus,"Caduceus is the The XMiDT server for delivering events from talaria to the registered consumer. 
Caduceus has one function: to deliver events to a consumer. To enable this, caduceus has three endpoints: 1) receive events, 2) register webhooks, and 3) get webhooks.

Notify - api/v3/notify endpoint
The notify endpoint will accept a msgpack encoding of a WRP Message. If a webhook is registered and matches the device regex and event regex, the event will be sent to the webhook's registered url. To register a webhook, refer to the webhook registration section

Webhook - /hook endpoint
To register a webhook and get events, the consumer must send an http POST request to caduceus that includes the http url for receiving the events and a list of regex filters. The following is an example request. Note: this is not a valid json because of the added comments.
"
How is Device Management done in RDK? ,"Device Management is an indispensable requirement to support large scale deployment. This helps in:

Controlled bulk operations/data retrievals
Firmware(code) download
Dynamically enable/disable features
Retrieving field matrices
XCONF/DCM is a management service that delivers certain configuration details to set-top-boxes (STB). Remote devices like set top boxes have settings to control certain activities. For instance, STBs need to know when to upload log files, or when to check for a new firmware update. In order to remotely manage a large population of devices, we need a solution that lets support staff define instructions and get the instructions to the devices. These are Device Configuration Manager (DCM) and Xconf (X1 Configuration Manager). DCM and Xconf are management services that delivers certain configuration details to set-top-boxes (STB). 

Xconf (X1 Configuration Manager) and Device Configuration Manager (DCM) began as separate solutions. Both the server and STB implementations evolved separately, yet both had overlapping functionality. Now, engineers have consolidated the server modules. The single name of the device configuration management service is XCONF. In the client side, the scripts and components are still named as DCM.

Device Management feature is horizontally scaled between different RDK profiles (like RDK-V, RDK-B and RDK-C) as shown in the below diagram. This means that the same code can be shared between different RDK profiles.

XCONF has client component ie CPE device component and server side component. XCONF's primary purpose is to tell STBs where to send their log files and what telemetry metrics they should be sending. XCONF does not receive logs or telemetry from the boxes. It simply tells the CPE where to send log files or telemetry and what specific metrics it should be sending. XCONF also tells CPEs when, where (host), and how (protocol) to send this data.

XCONF server consists of two web applications: the Data Service part and Angular-admin (UI). CPEs query the XCONF Data Service to get their configuration details. Angular-admin (UI) allows administrators to create targeting rules and enter all the necessary configuration details for a rule.

Device Management features (using XCONF) include:

Code Download (Xconf, DCM)
Log Upload
Telemetry
RDK Feature Control (RFC)"
Tell me about WEBPA or Tr1d1um APIs,"Tr1d1um is an implementation of the WebPA API which enables communication with TR-181 data model devices connected to the XMiDT cloud as well as subscription capabilities to device events.

The WebPA API operations can be divided into the following categories:

Device Statistics - /stat endpoint
Fetch the statistics (i.e. uptime) for a given device connected to the XMiDT cluster. This endpoint is a simple shadow of its counterpart on the XMiDT API. That is, Tr1d1um simply passes through the incoming request to XMiDT as it comes and returns whatever response XMiDT provided.

CRUD operations - /config endpoints
Tr1d1um validates the incoming request, injects it into the payload of a SimpleRequestResponse WRP message and sends it to XMiDT. It is worth mentioning that Tr1d1um encodes the outgoing WRP message in msgpack as it is the encoding XMiDT ultimately uses to communicate with devices.

Event listener registration - /hook(s) endpoints
Devices connected to the XMiDT Cluster generate events (i.e. going offline). The webhooks library used by Tr1d1um leverages AWS SNS to publish these events. These endpoints then allow API users to both setup listeners of desired events and fetch the current list of configured listeners in the system."

"What is a ""Bounded Context""?","Bounded context is a central pattern in Domain-Driven Design. 

A bounded context is a boundary within a domain where a particular domain model applies.

A domain model acts as a Ubiquitous Language to help communication between software developers and domain experts.
It acts as the conceptual foundation for the design of the software itself - how it's broken down into functions.

A model needs to be unified: it needs to be internally consistent so that there are no contradictions within it. 

A bounded context groups functionality according to whether various functions will share a single domain model.

What is the WRP or Web Routing Protocol?,"Web Routing Protocol -  core message envelope used by Xmidt and it's associated services.

Mechanism for routing
communication protocols: websocket, http, socket
Goal:

enable devices to interact with a centralized web router (Xmidt cluster) that routes the messages to/from various services on the other side.
interact with millions of authorized devices in the field in a scalable manor.
OSI Layer Stack-Up:

WRP - WS - HTTP - TLS/SSL - TCP - IP - Physical
Why does Xmidt need WRP?

The XMiDT service is designed to be able to travel across different connection types (HTTP, Websocket, Nanomsg, etc) and subsequently needs a mechanism to collect all the details needed to deliver, process and respond to a request.
WRP MsgPack Encoding

When a WRP message is send, it is encoded using MsgPack regardless of how the API caller specifies it (MsgPack, JSON or via HTTP headers).
The Xmidt Cloud API Service (skytale) converts the incoming requests into MsgPack and sends it along.
This conversion is not free.
It costs your request time to be converted to MsgPack, so if you're trying to optimize the performance think about emitting WRP as MsgPack directly (like Tr1d1um does)."
What is Xconf OSS?,"Xconf OSS is a management platform for RDK configuration settings:

used by engineers and administrators
manage settings (system configuration) on RDK Device centrally.
Xconf has CPE device component and server-side component.

The Xconf server consists of two components:

the Data Service part
Xconf Management UI.
The Xconf Server REST API handle the request from Xconf Management UI and modify the data in Cassandra through the Xconf Data Service:

Firmware Configurations,
Common data sets (MAC list, Model and Environment),
telemetry profile,
Download location,
Remote Feature Control (RFC) and feature that are created, updated or deleted.
The Xconf Data Service is the main component of Xconf-OSS which communicates with the CPE.

The Xconf Dataservice is responsible to fetch the data from the Cassandra database and send it as a response when a CPE makes a request to the Xconf Data Service for the system configuration. "
Tell me about Xmidt.,"Xmidt (pronounced ""transmit"") is a set of back-end services that provide a communication layer and data path to devices for near real-time data gathering and steering. The Xmidt services are not made available to users. The ingress and southbound interfaces exposed to the internet are for device communication only.

Xmidt does not implement any business processes but is an enabler for business processes such as provisioning and de-provisioning and device management. Its primary function and use case is to establish and maintain a secure, bidirectional, and stable communication and data path between RDK-B Devices and upstream services.

An RDK-B device connects to the Xmidt cloud via the Xmidt client.
Cloud-based services can use the Xmidt cloud API to send and receive messages from the devices (Websocket based, bi-directional, asynchronous communication).
Push and pull data from the device.

If you're working with Prometheus metrics, leveraging Grafana is a natural step to unlock the full potential of your monitoring data."
What is Consul? And how does it help service discovery?,"Consul is a service networking solution developed by HashiCorp. It acts as a central control plane that automates various tasks related to service discovery, service mesh, traffic management, and even automated network updates. Here's a breakdown of how Consul helps with service discovery:

Understanding Service Discovery:
In modern architectures with microservices, applications are built as a collection of small, independent services. These services communicate with each other to fulfill user requests. Service discovery becomes crucial in this context, as it allows services to dynamically find and connect to other services they need to interact with.

Consul as the Registry
Consul acts as a distributed service registry. Here's what that means:
Service Registration: Services running on different machines or containers can register themselves with Consul. This registration process involves providing information like the service name, IP address, port number, and health checks.
Dynamic Service Catalog: Consul maintains a constantly updated catalog of all registered services. This catalog acts as a single source of truth for service locations and health.
Service Discovery for Clients: Applications or services that need to interact with other services can query Consul's service catalog to discover the location (IP address and port) of the desired service. Consul provides various mechanisms for service discovery, including DNS and an HTTP API.

Benefits of Consul for Service Discovery:
Dynamic and Scalable: Consul can handle a large number of services and automatically updates the service catalog as services register, deregister, or change their state.
Resilience: Consul is designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant. Even if some Consul nodes fail, the service discovery process continues to function.
Security: Consul offers features for securing service-to-service communication and access control to the service catalog.
Simplified Development: By centralizing service discovery, Consul reduces the complexity of developing microservices that need to find and interact with each other.

Consul in Action:
Imagine a microservice architecture where a frontend service needs to communicate with a backend service. Here's how Consul helps:
The backend service registers itself with Consul, providing its details like name, IP, and port.
The frontend service queries Consul's service catalog to discover the location of the backend service.
Consul provides the backend service's IP and port, allowing the frontend service to establish communication and make requests.

Beyond Service Discovery:
While service discovery is a core function, Consul offers a broader set of functionalities under the umbrella of service networking. These include:
Service Mesh: Consul can be used to create a service mesh that facilitates secure, reliable communication between services.
Traffic Management: Consul allows for controlling traffic flow between services for functionalities like load balancing and service rollouts.
Automated Network Updates: Consul can automatically configure network infrastructure (firewalls, load balancers) based on service registration, simplifying network management.
By leveraging Consul for service discovery and its broader service networking features, you can build more resilient, scalable, and manageable microservice architectures."
How does the Xconf Admin UI work?,"Application:
Angular-Admin module in xconf-oss has all the code related to UI and its functionality. It uses spring framework�s tools such as webmvc, spring-test. RESTful service to define all the web services. It uses maven as a project build tool and jetty plugin to deploy the application in jetty server. The User Interface is designed on AngularJS framework. JUNIT and Mockito for Unit testing and slf4j, log4j for logger. This module has dependency on other modules present in xconf-oss

User Interface :
    The Xconf-Angular-Admin(UI) provides the web interface for the user to define firmware configuration for different set top boxes with regards to their Model, Environment and MAC address. There are different features with different functionality for the user to define:
Common:   It lets the user define different types of Model, Environment, MAC Address
Firmware:  It lets the user define the firmware configuration for different set top boxes with respect to MAC address, Environment and Model.
DCM: It lets the user define the device configuration by managing formulas, Device setting, log upload settings, voice on demand settings, Upload repository and Test page.
Where device setting is to specify set top box when to send swu/stb requirements in addition to reboot.
Log upload setting is to specify STB, when and where to upload logs.
There are three levels of logs based on the cron jobs selected
Telemetry:  It lets the user to analyze of trends more powerful with lot of metrics. The telemetry section has the permanent profile, targeting rules and Test page.

Rest Controller:

    The rest controllers are responsible to create, delete, retrieve and update datasets from UI into Cassandra database. It is defined under controller in xconf-angular-admin. These controllers handle the request from UI and modify the data in Cassandra through dataservice. All the request are handled by dispatcher servlet and passed to other servlet as defined in web.xml. The logging functionality defined in web.xml as a filter logs every request handled by the controllers.

How does Petasos function?,"Petasos has one function: to redirect incoming requests to the correct talaria. The two types of requests are from a device looking to connect to talaria and from scytale looking to forward a request to a device. In either case, petasos returns an http 307 redirect to the talaria. Petasos determines the correct talaria via service discovery configuration. Currently, petasos can be configured either to dynamically coordinate talarias via Consul (consul option) or be statically configured (fixed option). Refer to cluster configuration for more information.

Any URI paths (e.g. /api/v2/device, /api/v2/device/send) will be redirected to the talaria; petasos doesn't parse or validate the path in the request. In order for petasos to complete the request, the X-Webpa-Device-Name header must be included.

A helm chart can be used to deploy petasos to kubernetes
helm install xmidt-petasos deploy/helm/petasos
"
How does Themis function?,"Themis provides a flexible strategy to issue JWT tokens to devices that need to connect to the XMiDT cluster.

Endpoints
There are three main endpoints (directly mapped to servers key, issuer and claims in configuration) this service provides:

GET /keys/{KID} - PEM format
GET /keys/{KID}/key.json - JWK format
This endpoint allows fetching the public portion of the key that themis uses to sign JWT tokens. For example, Talaria can use this endpoint to verify the signature of tokens which devices present when they attempt to connect to XMiDT.

Configuration for this endpoint is required when the issue endpoint is configured and vice versa.

GET /issue
This is the main and most compute intensive Themis endpoint as it creates JWT tokens based on configuration.

GET /claims
Configuring this endpoint is required if no configuration is provided for the previous two.

JWT Claims Configuration
Claims can be configured through the token.claims, partnerID and remote configuration elements. The claim values themselves can come from multiple sources.

DELETE  /store/{bucket}/{id}    // Delete a record if exists in configured DB
    "
Explain the different functions of Argus as well as its main APIs.,"Argus has one function: interact with a database whether it is internal or external. To enable this, Argus has two endpoints: 1) individual items, and 2) buckets containing items.

Create Individual Item - store/{bucket}/{id} endpoint
This endpoint allows for clients to PUT an object into Argus. The placeholder variables in the path must contain:

bucket - The name used to indicate the resource type of which the stored data represents. A plural form of a noun word should be used for stylistic reasons. By default, the following rules will be enforced:

Bucket names must be between 3 and 63 characters long.
Bucket names can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens (-).
Bucket names must begin and end with a letter or number.
If you'd like to define your own bucket validation format, check out the userInputValidation.bucketFormatRegex configuration option.

ID - The unique ID within the name space of the containing bucket. It is recommended this value is the resulting value of a SHA256 calculation, using the unique attributes of the object being represented (e.g. SHA256(<common_name>)). This will be used by Argus to determine uniqueness of objects being stored or updated. Argus will not accept any values for this attribute that is not a 64 character hex string containing only 0-9 and a-f.

The body must be in JSON format with the following attributes:

ID - Required. Must match the ID provided in the URL.
data - Required. RAW JSON to be stored. Opaque to Argus.
ttl - Optional. Specified in units of seconds. Defaults to the value of the server configuration option itemMaxTTL. If a configuration value is not specified, the value would be a day (~ 24*60^2 seconds). )
An optional header X-Xmidt-Owner can be sent to associate the object with an owner. The value of this header will be bound to the new item, which would require the same value passed in a X-Xmidt-Owner header for subsequent reads or modifications. This in effect creates a secret attribute bound to the life of newly created items. When provided, Argus validates the length of the owner string to be in the range [10,60]. If you'd like to define your own validation format, check out the userInputValidation.ownerFormatRegex configuration option.

When the header is not provided, the owner of the item will be the empty string.

The exception to the above would be an authorized request. The authorization method is not specified and is up to the implementation to decide. Authorized requests shall be allowed to update all attributes except the X-Xmidt-Owner meta attribute.

List - store/{bucket} endpoint
This endpoint allows for GET to retrieve all the items in the bucket organized by the id.

An example response will look like the below where ""7e8c5f378b4addbaebc70897c4478cca06009e3e360208ebd073dbee4b3774e7"" is the id of the only item in this collection. An optional header X-Xmidt-Owner can be sent with the request. If supplied, only items with secrets matching the supplied value will be returned in the list. If not supplied, all items created without an owner (owner value = """") will be returned. For authorized requests, if no owner header is provided, all items for the specified bucket will be returned.

This endpoint allows for GET, and DELETE REST methods to interact with any object that was created with the previous PUT request. An optional header X-Xmidt-Owner can be sent with the request. All requests are validated by comparing the secret stored with the requested record with the value sent in the X-Xmidt-Owner header. If the header is missing, the """" (empty string) is assigned as the item's owner during item creation. A mismatch will result in a ""403 Forbidden"" error. An authorized request may override this requirement, providing an administrative override. The method of authorization is not specified.

Describe the main function for Talaria as well as its APIs,"Talaria has two main functions: Device Interactions, and Control Devices:

Device Interaction: Talaria's primary function is to interact with the devices. The communication with the device happens over a websocket using WRP Messages.

Talaria can send events originating from the device as well as emit its own events. When this occurs, the event is sent to Caduceus.

Talaria has three API endpoints to interact with the devices connected to itself. A XMiDT cloud client should not directly query against a talaria. Instead, they should send a request through scytale.

Device Statistics - /device/{deviceID}/stat endpoint
This will return the statistics of the connected device, including information such as uptime and bytes sent. This request does not communicate with the device, instead the request returns stored statistics.

Get Devices - /devices endpoint
This will return a list of all the actively connected devices and their statistics, just like the stat command.
Warning: this is an expensive request. Use with caution. This is not recommended to be used in production.

Send WRP to Device - /device/send endpoint
This will send a WRP message to the device. Talaria will accept a WRP message encoded in a valid WRP representation - generally msgpack or json. If the message is json encoded, talaria will encode the payload as msgpack. Talaria will then forward the message to the device. If the device returns a message, it will be encoded as the HTTP accept header. msgpack is the default encoding of the wrp message.


Control Devices
A secondary function of talaria is to control the connected devices. This allows for the flow of devices to go towards specific talarias. In other words, where the websockets are made can be controlled. For more information refer to Control Server Docs.

Gate Devices - /device/gate endpoint
This will allow or deny devices to connect to the talaria instance.

Drain Devices - /device/drain endpoint
This will remove the connected devices from the talaria instance.

Explain the TR-181 Device Data Model.,"Technical Report 181 (TR-181)  defines version 2 of the TR-069 Device data model (Device:2).

The Device:2 data model applies to all types of TR-069-enabled devices, including End Devices, Residential Gateways, and other Network Infrastructure Devices.

It is a set of data objects covering things like

basic device information,
time-of-day configuration,
network interface and protocol stack configuration,
routing and bridging management,
throughput statistics, and
diagnostic tests.
The cornerstone of the Device Data Model is the interface stacking mechanism. Network interfaces and protocol layers are modeled as independent data objects that can be stacked, one on top of the other, into whatever configuration a device might support.

Describe the TR-069 CPE WAN Management Protocol,"TR-069 CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP)

Technical Report 069 (TR-069) is a technical specification of the Broadband Forum that defines an application layer protocol for remote management of customer-premises equipment (CPE) connected to an Internet Protocol (IP) network,

TR-069 is a protocol for data exchange between the Auto Configuration Server (ACS) of a communication provider and an associated terminal at the customer.

A typical use case is the remote configuration of DSL routers by a broadband provider. Technically speaking, it is a bidirectional SOAP protocol for HTTP-based communication between customer premises equipment (CPEs) and auto-configuration servers (ACS). It is therefore also known as CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP).

Explain the main API endpoints for Scytale,"Scytale has two API endpoints to interact with the devices: 1) get the statistics for a device and 2) send a WRP Message to the device. If the device isn't connected, a 404 is returned.

Device Statistics - /api/v2/device/{deviceID}/stat endpoint
This will return the statistics of the connected device, including information such as uptime and bytes sent. This information is retrieved from the talaria that the device is connected to.

Send WRP to Device - /api/v2/device/send endpoint
This will send a WRP message to the device. Scytale will accept a WRP message encoded in a valid WRP representation - generally msgpack or json and will forward the request to the correct talaria."
What are some main features and advantages of RDK or RDK-B?,"The Reference Design Kit for Broadband(RDK-B) is a standard open source software stack which sits below the applications/services layer and provides a common interface to SoC's acting as a universal SoC adapter that allows portability across hardware platforms.  The RDK-B stack provides complex broadband and management functions such as Home Networking, WiFi, and Device Management. Even though almost all present RDK-B deployments are over DOCSIS gateways, its modular design makes RDK-B an ideal choice for a host of different devices like WiFi extenders, voice gateways or IoT platforms. 

RDK-B comes with some of the added advantages due to a highly modular architecture which allows the developers to have the provisions for dynamic service discovery, common data model, multiple management interfaces like SNMP, TR069, WebUI. Some of the added advantages of RDK-B are :

How do REST APIs work?,"REST APIs (Representational State Transfer APIs) are a prevalent method for applications to communicate with each other over the internet. They follow a client-server architecture where data is exchanged through HTTP requests and responses.

The Players Involved:
- Client: The application initiating the interaction. It could be a mobile app, a web browser, or another server.
- Server: The application that stores and manages the resources accessed through the API. It listens for incoming requests and sends back responses.


Core Components:
- FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name): This is the unique web address of the server hosting the API, like ""[invalid URL removed]"".
- Port: Think of a port as a specific doorway on the server. REST APIs typically use port 80 for regular HTTP traffic or port 443 for secure HTTPS traffic.
- Endpoint: This is a specific URL path within the API that identifies the resource the client wants to access. For instance, ""/users"" might be an endpoint to access user data.

The Request-Response Flow:

1. The Client Makes a Request: The client initiates the interaction by sending an HTTP request to the server. This request includes several parts:
HTTP Request Type: This verb specifies the desired action on the resource. Common types include:
GET: To retrieve data from the server.
POST: To create a new resource on the server.
PUT: To update an existing resource.
DELETE: To delete a resource.
Endpoint: The specific URL path of the resource the client wants to access (e.g., ""/users/123"" to access user with ID 123).
Headers: Optional information sent along with the request, like authentication details or data format preferences.
Body (for POST/PUT): For requests that create or update data, the client might send a body containing the actual data in a format like JSON.


2. The Server Sends a Response: Upon receiving the request, the server processes it and sends an HTTP response back to the client. The response contains:
Status Code: A three-digit code indicating the outcome of the request. Common codes include:
200 OK: The request was successful.
400 Bad Request: The request was invalid due to errors in the data or syntax.
404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found.
500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an error while processing the request.
Headers: Optional information sent along with the response, such as content type or authentication required for future requests.
Body (for successful requests): For successful GET or PUT requests, the server might include a body containing the requested data or confirmation of the update.


3. The Client Takes Action: Based on the status code and response body, the client application takes appropriate action. For instance, on a successful data retrieval (GET request with status code 200), the client might use the received data to populate its user interface.

Benefits of REST APIs:

Standardized: REST adheres to widely adopted HTTP protocols, making it easy for different applications to interact.
Scalable: REST APIs can handle a large number of requests efficiently.
Flexible: REST supports various data formats (JSON, XML) and HTTP methods for different actions.
Stateless: Each request-response interaction is independent, simplifying server-side development.
In essence, REST APIs provide a well-defined way for applications to communicate and exchange data over the web using familiar HTTP concepts.

Explain everything about the TR-181 device data model in detail,"TR-181, also known as the Device Data Model for CWMP Endpoints and USP Agents, is a technical report by the Broadband Forum (BBF) that defines a standardized data model for exchanging information between Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) devices and management systems. It works hand-in-hand with the TR-069 protocol (CPE WAN Management Protocol) for remote management of CPE devices.

Understanding the TR-181 Data Model:

Standardized Data Representation: TR-181 defines a hierarchical data structure with objects and parameters that represent various aspects of a CPE device's configuration and operational state. This standardization allows different management systems to understand and interpret data received from various CPE devices.
Focus on Manageability: The data model primarily focuses on parameters relevant to remote management tasks like configuration, diagnostics, and monitoring.
Hierarchical Structure: The data model is organized hierarchically, with the ""Device"" object at the root. Subsequent levels represent specific functionalities of the device, like ""InternetGatewayDevice"", ""LAN"", ""Wi-Fi"", etc. Within each object, there are specific parameters that provide detailed configuration options and operational data.
Benefits of TR-181:

Simplified Management: The standardized data model enables different management systems to communicate with various CPE devices without needing vendor-specific implementations.
Interoperability: TR-181 fosters interoperability between CPE devices from different manufacturers and management systems from various vendors.
Efficient Data Exchange: The defined data structure ensures efficient exchange of management information between the CPE and management system.
Things to Consider:

Focus on Management: While TR-181 covers a wide range of parameters for configuration and monitoring, it doesn't encompass all aspects of a device's functionality.
Versioning: The TR-181 data model has gone through several revisions, with newer versions incorporating additional functionalities for managing newer technologies. It's important to ensure compatibility between the CPE device's TR-181 version and the management system's capabilities.

"Can you explain how OneShop's sales inventory solution manages real-time synchronization across different channels, handles device states and reservations, updates inventory dynamically, and integrates various technological components like MongoDB, Elastic Search, and Netflix Conductor to maintain accurate and timely inventory updates, while addressing challenges such as multi-tenancy, synchronization between physical inventory and device pool databases, and ensuring the consistency of device state information across sales channels?","The sales inventory solution of OneShop, our e-commerce product, is a multitenant solution unified for all channels including OneShop, OneApp, etc., and natcos. It ensures near-real-time synchronization between sales views and warehouse stock. The inventory management flow involves an admin updating stocks of devices in the inventory whenever a new batch of devices is received. A user on a channel such as web or app shows interest in devices available in stock, and as soon as the user adds a device to his shopping cart, it gets reserved for a specified number of minutes. If a user places an order within this timeframe, the device count is subtracted from the stock. Once devices from the pool are exhausted, the admin updates the pool again. The system handles a few important states of products: IN-STOCK if more than one unit of a device is available in the warehouse, OUT-OF-STOCK if no units are available, and available for PRE-ORDER if it is a new exclusive launch. The synchronization challenge involves ensuring that the device listing powered from the Sales Catalog reflects the correct state (IN-STOCK, OUT-OF-STOCK, PRE-ORDER) of the device. Creating a reservation in Sales Inventory for the specified minutes may update the status of the device if there was only one unit of the device left in stock, signifying a transition of device state from IN-STOCK to OUT-OF-STOCK. Cancelling a reservation in Sales Inventory after the specified minutes should influence the status of the device if there was only one unit of the device left in stock, signifying a transition of device state from OUT-OF-STOCK to IN-STOCK. We addressed the synchronization between physical inventory and devices pool database, how to reserve a device for a specified duration, ensuring the device reservation expires at the correct time, achieving consistency between real-time user orders and inventory updates by an admin, and updating Elastic Search documents in the sales catalog with the correct state to ensure IN-STOCK devices come on top. The tech stack includes MongoDB, Elastic Search, Netflix Conductor (orchestration engine), and Spring Boot-based microservices. We broke down the problem into four parts: Status synchronization event-driven core is used as the center of the implementation to synchronize the status of the device due to operations like inventory load, reservation updates, and orders. Any update operation in sales inventory (POST/PUT) leads to a change in data in MongoDB, generating a change event which is listened by a change stream event listener running in the sales inventory microservice. This listener starts a conductor workflow which then starts a task calculate_capacity_status executed in an inventory microservice to compute the status of the device by reading available stock and count of the number of reservations at the moment. The conductor then makes a decision whether there is a change of status in the sales catalog, and if the state change is applicable, it starts a task update_catalog_capacity_status to update the state of the device in ES. This task is executed in the sales catalog microservice to update the status of a device from IN-STOCK to OUT-OF-STOCK and vice versa. Load data into sales inventory can be done manually by admin or real-time requests from the warehouse through inventory admin UI or automatically through a distributor connected to the warehouse. POST API operations on sales inventory lead to the data change in MongoDB which then executes the 'Status synchronization event-driven core' shown above. Sales inventory updates on add to cart involve an addition of an item to a shopping cart or submitting an order which can lead to a change in the state of the device. Whenever an item is added to a shopping cart, it is reserved for the specified duration in a temporary document with a TTL within the reservation collection. When the reservation expires, documents get deleted from the collection and change stream events trigger the 'Status synchronization event-driven core'. The same happens in the case of submitting an order, meaning promotion of reservation to order, hence the actual count of inventory is decremented and triggers the 'Status synchronization event-driven core'. Exposure of status to channels involves querying the status or count of each device left in stock as Sales inventory exposes simple GET operations from its core for this purpose. The solution highlights include a modular and event-driven design, with multiple microservices being loosely coupled, the use of mongo change event to listen to every change in the state of inventory, conductor workflows to remove coupling between sales catalog and sales inventory, and a single driver to update the change in the state of devices."

"How has the implementation of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, CICD  transformed the software development lifecycle at OneShop, particularly in addressing the challenges of manual deployments across multiple micro-services? Could you discuss the specific strategies employed, such as the adoption of environment-based branching, the roles of different branches ('dev', 'qa', 'release', and 'master'), and the integration of Nexus profiles for managing artifacts? Additionally, how have these changes facilitated a smoother workflow and reduced the time to market for new releases?","A development process involves crafting code and initiating deployment, a practice that unfortunately resulted in significant time consumption for OneShop. The reason was that micro-services were built directly in the environments without knowing if the code was in a buildable state. Like many of us, we'd fix things as we went along, but it was clear that we needed to streamline this process. That's when Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) entered the scene. Before we dive into the problem, let�s take a quick stroll down memory lane to see how things used to be: We followed the Agile methodology, working in two-week sprints and branching our code based on release patterns like release-. (e.g., release-23.20). Publishing shared JAR files on Nexus was a manual task, which, as you can imagine, could get quite tedious. The deployment process required multiple clicks and checks just to ensure a single deployment went smoothly. And to top it all off, we were doing manual deployments for 10�15 micro-services. Can you say �time-consuming�? So yeah, things needed a bit of a makeover. When you see �manual,� it�s a sign of trouble. And those slow deployments caused by the assembly line of jar building? We need to make that process faster and smoother! The Branching Strategy The brainstorming session started by taking a hard look at the current way of managing branches. This involved keeping a branch for each release cycle, using one version for all shared libraries, and doing manual builds (with Jenkins, but still a hands-on process) It had its perks; it made keeping track of versions and supporting older releases straightforward. But, as you can imagine, it had its fair share of problems too like delayed integration, a complicated build process, and a confusing CI setup. In the next step, we explored different branching strategies like trunk-based, feature-based, forking, and environment-based. After lots of discussions and brainstorming, the environment-based branching made the most sense. This environment-based branching strategy came with some real perks. For starters, it made Continuous Integration (CI) much easier to handle. It could still support multiple release versions using tags, and having a separate branch for each environment gave more control and clarity in the deployment process. So, all in all, it was a win-win. To tackle existing branching & manual deployment issues, a structured approach was adopted by introducing four specific branch types: �dev,� �qa,� �release,� and �master.� For a clearer understanding, please review the diagram below. Software development lifecycle in OneShop, incorporating branching strategies, deployment environments, and configuration management via Nexus profiles. It begins with the 'Dev' branch, a primary arena for active development where developers commit ongoing changes and enhancements. From here, changes are merged into the 'QA/Intermediate' branch for advanced testing and integration, ensuring that new features integrate seamlessly with existing code. This approach mitigates risks and promotes stable builds. Once the QA process confirms the build's stability, the code progresses to the 'Release' branch. This branch serves as a pre-production holding area, where final adjustments are made before the software is deemed ready for release. Post-validation in the release branch, the code is merged into the 'Master' branch, which represents the codebase's most stable version, ready for deployment to the production environment. Throughout this process, back-merging plays a critical role in ensuring all branches remain updated with the latest tested and approved code, minimizing conflicts and discrepancies across the development lifecycle. Specifically, code is frequently merged back from the 'QA/Intermediate' branch to the 'Dev' branch and from the 'Release' branch back to both 'QA/Intermediate' and 'Dev'. This ensures that any fixes or updates integrated during the testing phases are reflected back in the development branches. The environments section of the diagram delineates several stages of deployment: multiple development environments ('Dev' and 'Dev2') allow developers to test in isolated settings, preventing disruptions in the main development flow. Several staging environments ('Stage2', 'Stage3', 'Stage4', 'Stage5' 'Stage6', 'Stage7' and a general 'Stage') replicate the production environment, which is crucial for performance testing and final tweaks. The 'Preprod' and 'UAT' (User Acceptance Testing) environments are pivotal for final verifications by quality assurance teams and clients respectively, ensuring the software meets all user expectations and requirements. The 'Prod' environment is where the fully tested and approved application is finally deployed, accessible to end-users. Additionally, the 'Mkt' environment could suggest a specialized setting used for marketing or demonstrations to stakeholders. Lastly, the Nexus profiles outlined ('eshop-dev', 'eshop-qa', 'eshop-release', 'eshop-prod', and 'eshop-stage') correspond to different stages of the development pipeline in a Nexus repository"
"What led OneShop to evaluate its performance under heavy load conditions, and what were the initial findings?","OneShop evaluated its performance under heavy load to prepare for high-demand scenarios like sales or festive seasons.

How did reducing the response size initially impact OneShop's API performance?,"Reducing the response size by removing unnecessary HTML content from the API responses was intended to improve performance. Although this change did result in some improvement, it was not as significant as expected, suggesting other underlying performance issues."
"Why did OneShop decide to introduce a caching layer, and what was expected?","OneShop introduced a caching layer to achieve faster response times for duplicate requests, aiming to reduce the load on the backend servers and improve overall system performance."
What limitations did OneShop encounter after introducing caching to its system?,"Despite introducing caching, the performance improvements plateaued around 600 requests per second (RPS), which was already achievable through previous scaling efforts. This indicated that caching alone was insufficient to handle peak loads effectively."
How did thread dump analysis help OneShop identify performance bottlenecks?,"Thread dump analysis revealed that application threads were frequently in a WAITING state due to synchronous log writing, identifying excessive logging as a major performance bottleneck."
What specific actions did OneShop take to optimize its logging practices?,"OneShop optimized its logging by removing unnecessary logs, reducing log size, and moving to asynchronous log writing, which significantly relieved the load on the system by reducing waiting times for log writes."
How did asynchronous log writing improve OneShop's system performance?,"Asynchronous log writing minimized the waiting time of application threads that was previously caused by synchronous log operations, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and responsiveness of the system."
What further code optimization did OneShop implement after the second round of thread dump analysis?,"After identifying additional inefficiencies in the code, OneShop corrected unnecessary object-string conversions and streamlined various processes to further reduce system latency and improve API response times."
How did network limitations of EC2 machines affect OneShop's API scalability?,"Network limitations on EC2 machines restricted the response size per second, which limited the system's ability to scale up during peak traffic periods. OneShop considered increasing instance sizes and using burst credits to temporarily enhance capacity."
What role did burst credits play in OneShop's performance strategy?,"Burst credits allowed OneShop's EC2 instances to temporarily exceed their baseline performance limits during unexpected spikes in traffic, providing a short-term solution to maintain service levels."
How did the state of the AWS Elastic File System (EFS) impact OneShop's performance during high traffic periods?,"The state of the AWS Elastic File System (EFS), particularly when it became filled, significantly reduced the system's throughput. This highlighted the importance of monitoring and managing EFS capacity to avoid performance degradation."
What metrics did OneShop focus on improving through their various optimizations?,"OneShop focused on improving throughput, measured in requests per second (RPS), and response times, as reflected in their P95 graphs, which indicated significant enhancements from 600 RPS to around 2800 RPS after optimizations."
How did OneShop utilize the ELK Stack in their performance optimization efforts?,"The ELK Stack was used extensively by OneShop for logging and monitoring. It helped in analyzing log data and performance metrics, which were crucial for identifying issues and measuring the impact of implemented changes."
Describe the role of Grafana and Prometheus in OneShop's monitoring strategy.,Grafana and Prometheus were used by OneShop to fetch critical metrics and visualize performance data. These tools provided real-time insights into system health and were instrumental in proactive performance management.
How did AWS CloudWatch contribute to OneShop's ability to manage its infrastructure?,"AWS CloudWatch provided OneShop with first-hand information on infrastructure metrics, allowing them to monitor system performance, set alarms, and react swiftly to potential issu"
"What ongoing challenges does OneShop face in maintaining API performance, and what is their approach moving forward?","OneShop recognizes that maintaining API performance is an ongoing challenge, requiring continual monitoring, testing, and optimization. They plan to keep refining their strategies and adapting to new technologies to ensure scalability and reliability."
"Provide me the blog link which was written by Pratish Bhatnagar from OneShop Backend on scaling up SLC API, or Sales Catalog API.",Here is the detailed blog on SLC API scaling which was one : https://medium.com/deutsche-telekom-gurgaon/how-we-scaled-up-the-sales-catalog-api-19eb582b5c97
"Can you provide a detailed overview of the scalability challenges faced with the Sales Catalog API at OneShop, the strategies implemented for SLC API scaling, and the overall impact on system performance, including the specific measures taken to optimize API response times and manage system load effectively?","Scaling Sales Catalog APIs and, in turn, scaling OneShop APIs. The backstory goes like this�a few months back, the business decided to check how OneShop performs when put under heavy load and in a sudden burst of traffic. To our surprise, the system did not scale up as expected and instead started failing and throwing errors to the end user. Our device and tariff listing pages had failed us. What did we do? As any engineer would when faced with API failures due to load, the first thing we did was to increase the number of Sales Catalog API Pods (Horizontal Scaling). This increased the throughput to an extent, but we started getting failures after a point. The next thing that came to our mind was to increase the resources available to the APIs. In this case, it meant increasing the number of nodes in our ElasticSearch Cluster and also increasing the size of each ElasticSearch Node in the cluster. This further reduced the number of API failures and provided us with much-needed time to dig deeper into this problem. We started analyzing the response from each layer, the databases, and each API being called to serve the listing response. We found out that we were passing HUGE pieces of HTML Content (Thank you, Admins :-) ) that were of no use in the listing response. So, we chalked that out. And voila! The APIs started performing as expected! Sadly, this was not the case. The performance improved but was nowhere near what we wanted. We introduced a separate caching layer in our application because why not! The expectation after introducing caching was clear: blazing-fast responses for duplicate requests. This is what we thought as well. Yet again, this was not the case. In our load tests, we found that the throughput did not increase much even after adding a caching layer. It started plateauing around 600 RPS. This was what we had already achieved after scaling up the production environment and was not something we were aspiring for.We tried taking thread dumps from pods and started analyzing them. We found something very unexpected during our analysis. Until this point, we had not expected our logs to be a bottleneck for the application. After all, these are the best weapons we have when fighting a production issue. During our thread dump analysis, we found that the application threads were in a WAITING state just to write logs. This opened multiple fronts for us: we are printing too many unnecessary logs, the log size is very large and needs to be reduced, since our response payload can be fairly large, it meant an increased load on the logging system, and the logs are written in a synchronous fashion. We performed these steps to overcome these problems: we removed the unnecessary logs and updated the log levels as per the severity, we stopped the unnecessary printing of objects in logs, we removed the response objects from our logs, and we moved to asynchronous writing of logs. After fixing the logs, we went again to further analyze the thread dumps. We found further issues with the code. The threads were still in a WAITING state. We found that we were unnecessarily converting objects to string and vice versa before responding to the request. We fixed this as well and were ready for our last leg. After all the optimizations, we started performing regular load tests on the APIs and overnight soak tests. We observed that after multiple successful runs, an odd run would fail unexpectedly, or the system would not scale as much, or would scale down and plateau to a constant RPS. Upon digging deep into this problem, we read about machine network limitations and burst credits. To summarize, each EC2 machine can only send out a limited response size per second. This can be increased by increasing the instance size or momentarily using burst credits. Now we had found the answers! We had achieved the limits of the available hardware and were even using the burst credits. This was the reason for the dip in response and plateauing of the RPS graph. In our tests, we found that the throughput depended upon the state of the AWS Elastic File System as well. This is the place where we write our logs. When the EFS filled up, the RPS reduced and the system would not scale up. We use the ELK Stack for our logging needs. So, we leveraged that to plot graphs to measure the response times against the critical operation times. These should be very much near each other. We also used Grafana and Prometheus to fetch the critical metrics of the application. We also used AWS CloudWatch extensively to get first-hand information on our infrastructure. Using the above-mentioned approach, we were able to increase the throughput of the APIs from 600 RPS to around 2800RPS. Our P95 Graphs also improved indicating the improvement in response times. We were able to increase these metrics and the system survives under spikes and huge loads. However, the API performance track cannot be closed and is a never-ending process."
